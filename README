adbx is a tool for interacting with Android systems.  It does much of
what adb does, but with better remote shell support and, hopefully,
fewer bugs.  Differences between adb and adbx are that adbx

  * transmits and updates window size
  * distinguishes standard output and standard error
  * properly muxes streams with independent flow control
  * allows for ssh-like pty allocation control
  * propagates program exit status instead of always exiting
    with status 0
  * properly escapes program arguments
  * kills remote program
